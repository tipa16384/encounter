# Encounter
## a single encounter roguelike
### written in one day while bored

1. Download `encounter.zip` from the `dists` folder
2. Unzip it somewhere
3. Run `encounter.exe`. It _should_ run, even if you don't have Python installed.
4. All the commands you can use are shown. Examine those carefully.
5. You are faster than the dragon, but it has some advantages.

If I get ambitious, I will add a graphical UI and some enhancements. I may even do other
encounters.

The file `map.txt` is the input to the program. You could rearrange stuff. I wouldn't make it wider or taller;
I hardcoded a lot of x,y positions. It definitely needs cleaning up.
